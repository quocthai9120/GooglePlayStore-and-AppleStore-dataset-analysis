    "\n",
    "- Nowadays, there is a huge number of smartphone applications. Moreover, there are also a huge number of applications that used to get a task done. From the publisher's perspective, so as to get more users for their applications, they need to understand the current state of the market that they publish the application to. From the users' perspective, in order to find the applications that really help them with their task, they also need to understand the market that they are finding application from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of markets for smartphone applications, while Google Play Store and Apple Store are the two most popular markets, Google Play Store is undeniable currently much more dominating compared to Apple Store thanks to the Android Platform, according to [comScore](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Market-Rankings/comScore-Reports-January-2015-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share). With that reason, it is extremely important to analyze Google Play Store market to understand several relationships and facts on that market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project will analyze Google Play Store market to find the relationships between different numeric factors and find the factor that most affect another. Moreover, the project will also analyze the distribution of the factors to understand the behavior of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The statistical data about the relationships between different numerical factors on Google Play Store market is important and necessary for industries, developers, and publishers to compute and manage their products, predict the profits, clients, values, ... of the products, and to predict and estimates other products. Besides, the user can be based on the statistics to know what criteria they should look for while finding an application, which will improve their productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, it is necessary to understand the difference between the Android market and the IOS market so as to understand the state of the Android market. Therefore, I will also briefly compare the distribution of sizes of applications on the Google Play Store analysis with the Apple Store. With that results, people will be able to balance the products to be suitable with the market when creating applications, which will help them to plan for their products to serve a larger range of clients."

Therefore, depends on the distribution of each pair of factors, they may have a relationship other than a linear correlation.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Because the price of most applications in the dataset has a range from 0 to 400 USD, while the number of installs gets up to $10^{9}$, we need to shrink the range of the \"Installs\" column by getting its logarithm to make it less extreme.\n",
